  I'm assuming you are running windows since you mention an .exe file extension.
  Look in the debug and/or release subdirectories of your project to find the produced binary.
  You can double-click on it to run the application. However, there are several DLL's that will be required.
  So, make sure they are in your PATH or copy them in the same directory.
  Dependency Walker is useful for finding out what you need.
